        <h2>Hi, I am Hung<br />Senior Software Engineer & FIDE Instructor</h2>
        <p>
          With over 10 years of experience in software engineering, I’ve worked
          across key domains such as Fintech, E-commerce, Education, and Digital
          Marketing. I specialize in modern technologies including Python,
          React, Node.js, and Shopify, and have collaborated with clients in the
          US, EU, Singapore, and Vietnam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside engineering, I am a certified FIDE School Instructor with
          strong experience in teaching and coaching chess. I’ve guided students
          in both rapid and blitz formats, with several earning gold prizes in
          competitions. I’m passionate about helping learners grow—whether in IT
          or on the chessboard.
